# PromptOps
PromptOps is an open-source toolbox for working with large language models in a repeatable, vendor-neutral way. It provides shared prompts, adapters, and CLI shims that let tools like Claude-CLI, OpenAI, and local models behave consistently, without rewriting workflows every time a model or API changes.
